For 2024 I’ve decided to try the [Happiness Trifecta](https://gretchenrubin.com/getting-started-the-24-for-2024-trifecta/) as  mentioned on the Happier with Gretchen Rubin podcast.

The challenge is: Write 2-4 or 24 minutes every day. (Happier Podcast challenge).

My one-word theme is “Communication.”

# Communication (Portfolio)

Det finns mycket kul här under. Mål att varje vecka jobba med ett kommunikationsprojekt som jag kan dela publikt, typ bygga min portfolio vore ju inte dumt.

 (bredare än email, men samtidigt inte admin)

- Töm alla inkorgar
- Svara på konversationer
- Starta nya konversationer
- Blogga (Memento Mori)
- YouTube - kommunikation via film
- Hackathons och hobby projekt - kommunikation via kod.
- Songwriting/Composing - kommunikation via musik.
- Photography - kommunikation via bilder.

1. MC-kort
2. Tattoo (decide on what and where, who).
3. Become more independent by moving to an apartment.
4. Begin lifting weights at a gym in Stockholm.
    1. I told myself all I needed to do is get to the gym with my bag and stay for ten minutes, then I'm free to go home if I want.” in the beginning, the idea is to get comfortable with simply being in the gym. To become the type of person who goes to the gym four days per week.
5. Release a song as a Music NFT on Sound.xyz.
6. Produce and Publish 24 videos to YouTube.
7. Summer of Biographies.
8. Finish the outline of my memoir. (decide what stories and people to include).
9. Race every month (running, triathlon, OCR, etc.)
10. Perform music at 10 Open Mic Nights.
11. Brew 3 new beers at home (lager, IPA and ….).
12. Go to a Sunday service in church once a month.
13. Start my freelancing business (offer services within the fields of IT, Music, Video and Photo).
14. Try a new recipe from my liquorice cook book every month.
15.  Attend 10 new meetup groups , to expand my network.
16. Travel to Spain (on motorcycle?). (Celebrate my birthday in Valencia?)
17. Compose my first song for a (32-note?) music box and play it with paper strips. 
18. Take a date to a Sofar sound(s) concert.
19. Attend a Blockchain/Web3/NFT conference outside of Sweden.
20. Upgrade my home office (need an external monitor).
21. Try a new hairstyle
22. Start playing in a band (duo or larger).
23. Write 2-4 or 24 minutes every day. (Happier Podcast challenge).
24. Start a guided visualisation practice.
25. Free space!
