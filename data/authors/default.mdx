## Dream BIG

This blog is all about getting the most out of life. I began sharing my thoughts on achieving goals and life design in October 2016.

The purpose is to create a layer of accountability and hopefully inspire you to take action in an area where you'd like to see change.
Perhaps you are just looking for motivation or different ideas and perspectives.

I am doing this partly as a pet project, partly because writing is quite therapeutical, but also to inspire others to constantly improve their lives and achieving their **BIGGEST** goals and dreams. Nothing is to big, it all starts with a small step. **Today**.

## Hej, I'm Rasmus!

**On a journey to accomplish my Dreams.** ðŸ¤˜

I'm a Swede in my early 30's who enjoy most creative endevaours.


Besides writing about my life, I'm also known for playing music and [writing songs](https://soundcloud.com/happystinson/sets/original-songs), [making videos for YouTube](https://youtube.com/@BangersNBiz), improving the world through code, [capturing the moment](https://www.flickr.com/people/ras-nordling/), and challenging my body and mind. I need that time where I can appreciate the outdoors and discover new places.

I'm a Libra, [INTP](https://www.mbtionline.com/en-US/MBTI-Types/INTP), and a [Questioner](https://gretchenrubin.com/four-tendencies/).<br />
I don't like staying in the same place for too long and so far I've lived in Stockholm[^1], Ronneby[^2], Karlskrona[^3], and Brisbane[^4].

**Favourite novel**: Stephen King - [The Eyes of the Dragon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10611.The_Eyes_of_the_Dragon).  
**Favourite non-fictional book**: James Clear - [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits).<br />
**Favourite Songs**: [topp 100](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2iAyT4s1sacVz6mWCn700r?si=415c1be03c70491e).
